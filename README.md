# Super Roboboys Adventure
 
This was made for Jame Gam #2 (yes, i spelled it right) which lasted 2 weeks. The theme was "The more you get, the worse it gets" and the limitation was "Power Source."

What I made was Super Roboboy's Adventure, a Super Mario Bros. inspired platformer.

The game is about roboboy whose girlfriend gets kidnapped by the evil bot, and he has to go save her. The main mechanic is that you can collect gold and collect gold will increase your speed and jump power, but if you get hit or fall in a pit, you lose your gold. Also the more gold you have the harder the enemies will appear because they are greedy or something. 
Another mechanic that is in the game but that is really pointless is the ability to shoot gold! Why you ask? well, so you can give to the enemies to leave you alone, but of course! 

Overall, its really janky, unpolished, and in general not fun. Like, stomping enemies doesn't work half the time, and you will get damaged instead! BRUH

pls pls pls don't play this
